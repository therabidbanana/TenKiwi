# tenkiwi

This is the server component for Tenkiwi. The client side is available at
https://github.com/therabidbanana/tenkiwi-client

## Development

Open a terminal and type `lein repl` to start a Clojure REPL
(interactive prompt).

In the REPL, type

```clojure
(go)
```

The call to `(go)` starts the Figwheel server at port 3449, which takes care of
live reloading ClojureScript code and CSS, and the app server at port 10555
which forwards requests to the http-handler you define.


## Testing

To run the Clojure tests, use

``` shell
lein test
```

## Deploying to Heroku

This assumes you have a
[Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/dc), have installed the
[Heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/), and have done a
`heroku login` before.

``` sh
git init
git add -A
git commit
heroku create
git push heroku master:master
heroku open
```

## Running with Foreman

Heroku uses [Foreman](http://ddollar.github.io/foreman/) to run your
app, which uses the `Procfile` in your repository to figure out which
server command to run. Heroku also compiles and runs your code with a
Leiningen "production" profile, instead of "dev". To locally simulate
what Heroku does you can do:

``` sh
lein with-profile -dev,+production uberjar && foreman start
```

Now your app is running at
[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in production mode.
